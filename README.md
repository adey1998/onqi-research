# Onqi Research

This repository contains research prototypes and experiments for building AI-powered clinical decision support tools for lung cancer screening and beyond.  
Each publication is organized into its own folder under `publications/`.



## Publication 1: Closing the Lung Cancer Screening Gap in FQHCs

This MVP supports the first research paper:

1. **Synthetic Dataset Generation** ‚Äì Create ~100‚Äì200 mock patient records (structured + unstructured).
2. **NLP Extraction Engine** ‚Äì Extract smoking history and quit date from clinical notes.
3. **Eligibility Rules Engine** ‚Äì Apply USPSTF lung cancer screening guidelines.
4. **Evaluation** ‚Äì Measure NLP accuracy (precision, recall, F1).
5. **Results & Outputs** ‚Äì Generate tables, charts, and workflow diagram for publication.
